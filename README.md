    TODO: Insert html  link

or by generating the doxygen-based documentation manually. 

To generate the documentation, in a terminal:
    1: change the directory to the root of the ChiDG project. That is, 'ChiDG/'.
    2: run the doxygen command as:  'doxygen doc/ChiDG.cfg' 
    3: HTML documentation can be found in 'doc/html/index.html'
