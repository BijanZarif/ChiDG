Documentation

    Documentation for the code can be obtained either by downloading a copy from the gitlab page at:

        TODO: Insert html  link

    or by generating the doxygen-based documentation manually. 

    To generate the documentation, in a terminal:
        1: change the directory to the root of the ChiDG project. That is, 'ChiDG/'.
        2: run the doxygen command as:  'doxygen doc/ChiDG.cfg' 
        3: HTML documentation can be found in 'doc/html/index.html'
        4: PDF documentation can be generated by changing directories to 'ChiDG/dox/latex' and
           executing the 'make' command.
